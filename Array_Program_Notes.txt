Array Rotation- 1) Naive Approach-Rotate Array with temporary array of "d" size
				2) Rotate Array with One by One element
				3) Rotate Array with Juggling method(gcd approach)
				4) Reversal Alogorithm --Reverse A to get ArB, where Ar is reverse of A.
										 Reverse B to get ArBr, where Br is reverse of B.
										 Reverse all to get (ArBr) r = BA.
